# Text Editor
Online and offline text editor.

## Description
This is a text editor web application.<br>
When you open the application in your editor you will see a client/server folder structure.<br>
When you run `npm run start` from the root directory the application will start up the backend and serve the client.<br>
When you run the text editor application from your terminal you will see that JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack.<br>
When you run your webpack plugins you will see that you have generated and HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file.<br>
When you use next-gen JavaScript in the application you will find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors.<br>
When you open the text editor you will see that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage.<br>
When you enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window you will find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB.<br>
When you reopen the text editor after closing it you will find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from the IndexedDB.<br>
When you click on the Install button then you download the web application as an icon on your desktop.<br>
When you load your web application you will have a registered service worker using workbox.<br>
When you register a service worker you will have static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets.<br>
This has been deployed to Heroku and has proper build scripts for a webpack application.<br>
